# Use YouTube Data API to update video

This repository is associated with [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/KP6cAi-GKjE).

In [this](https://youtu.be/KP6cAi-GKjE) video we made an app that uses the YouTube Data API to update video details like title or thumbnail. 

## Install application

In order to install the application you just have to clone the repository and run `npm install` in the project root folder.

## Start the application

To start the app first run `node auth.js` and complete the auth process to get a token (Make sure the file `credentials/youtube-tokens.json` was generated successfully).

Go into `app.js` and change the video id. After that, use `node app.js` to run the app.
